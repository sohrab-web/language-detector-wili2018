README — Language Detection Model
This project contains a language detection model trained using Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and a HashingVectorizer (character-level n-grams).

It can detect the language of:
1.Single sentences
2.Paragraphs
3.Full documents (.txt, .docx, .pdf)
The model is lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate into any application or API.


#DATASET OVERVIEW
Dataset: WiLI-2018
The model uses the WiLI-2018 – Wikipedia Language Identification Dataset, a standard benchmark dataset for language identification research.
Name: WiLI-2018
Source: Wikipedia
Languages: 235 languages
Samples per language: 1,000 training + 1,000 test sentences
Total size: 235,000 training samples + 235,000 test samples
Format: UTF-8 plain text

#About the Developer:
This project was developed by Sohrab Khan as part of practical work in NLP and applied machine learning.
The goal was to build a useful tool that solves a real task: automatically determining the language of any given text or document.
This shows hands-on ability in ML, Python, and practical model integration.
